# My-Courses
Depicts classes taken and content learned in Graduate School at Harvard University


# Fall 2019

A. Advanced Python for Data Science 
- Key topics include formal collaboration techniques, testing,
continuous integration and deployment, repeatable and intuitive workflows with directed graphs,
recurring themes in practical algorithms, meta-programming and glue, performance optimization, and
an emphasis on practical integration with tools in the broader data science ecosystem such as GitHub,
Docker, Amazon Web Services, and Hadoop.

B. Data Science with Python (https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/)
- Goes through the main facets of investigation using Data
data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;
data management - accessing data quickly and reliably;
exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition;
prediction or statistical learning; and
communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries

C. Elements of Data Science and Statistical Learning with R
Elementary probability and statistics + Definition, principles, types of statistical learning; model quality, bias-variance tradeoff
Simple and multiple linear regression, Assessing model prediction quality, cross-validation, bootstrap
Model selection and regularization: dimensionality reduction, ridge and lasso
Unsupervised learning: clustering approaches (K-means, hierarchical clustering)
Supervised learning: classification problem
Classification using logistic regression, discriminant analysis, naïve Bayes
Classification with Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks


# Spring 2019

A. Oracle Database Administration 
- Learned how to create and explore a database from scratch as well as administer it while scaling it successfully. 
Amazon's AWS platform was used to deploy the database as well as perform any needed modifications. 

B. Python Programming 
- Class depicted most modernized approaches to solving important tasks in Python with the most up to date libraries and functions. 
Several projects and code were utilized in createing several Jupyter Notebooks. 
Numerical Analysis, Data modelling, OOP, Machine learning- Decision Trees, Regression analysis, Clustering and Classification Scikit-Learn.
Linear algebra, probability and statistics, numerical performance with numpy/pandas, Networkx, graphing and visuaizations learned.  

C. Statistical Modelling 
- Further examination of statistics and data analysis beyond the introductory course. 
Topics include t‐tools and permutation‐based alternatives including bootstrapping, multiple‐group comparisons, analysis of variance, 
linear regression, model checking and refinement. Statistical computing and simulation based emphasisusing programming in the R statistical package. 
Emphasis is made on thinking statistically, evaluating assumptions, and developing tools for real‐life applications.

# Fall 2018

A. Big Data, IOT and CyberSecurity 
- Outlines several topics covering broad range applications and challenges as well as some niche opportunities of Big data, IOT and Cybersecurity. 

B Harvard Probability (Graduate level Stat 110- Most sought after Math class at Harvard)
- The most famous statistics and probabilty class at Harvard University which teaches students "How to Think". 
This class has a focus on how to calculate difficult probabilities and  the math behind difficult to grasp concepts. 

C. Intro to Arc Mapping, GIS 
- Geographic Information Systems based applications and concepts in effectively creating, exploring and visualizing maps using software. 
Huge emphasis on the ESRI software base and ARC GIS software suite.
